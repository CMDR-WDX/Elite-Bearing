# How to use
Under the *You are here*-Section enter your current lat/long values. You can find them in the game on the bottom right. The upper value is your latitude, the lower value is your longitude. 

Under the *You want to get here*-Section enter the coordinates you want to go to.

The tool will then enter the heading you want to take to get there. You can find the planetary heading at the top of your screen when close to a planet.

Update the *You are here*-Section with new values to correct your heading until you arrive at your destination.
